This site contains my _experimental_ projects done with the awesome developer environment [DDEV](https://ddev.com/) (Open Source).

These experiments can best be classified as ["dev ops"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)-experiments.  In many cases I tried to support the usage of the cloud IDE [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) as well to support both local and in-browser development usage.

Thanks for all people sharing their DDEV snippets and examples! Please consider [sponsoring DDEV maintainer Randy Fay](https://github.com/sponsors/rfay) if you use DDEV in your daily work.
