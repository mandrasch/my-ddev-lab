**DDEV providers (pull) integration**

It is easy to pull the `fileadmin/` and database via `ddev pull` ([Hosting integration](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/providers/)). See [rsync example](https://github.com/drud/ddev/blob/master/pkg/ddevapp/dotddev_assets/providers/rsync.yaml.example).

::: info
WANTED: Example code. If you have a ddev/providers/-script which pulls database and file admin, please let me know!
