# Craft CMS

::: info
ðŸš§ &nbsp; This chapter is work in progress (WIP) . Happy to hear [your feedback / ideas](https://github.com/mandrasch/my-ddev-lab/issues)!
:::

## Quickstart

Based on [Intro to CraftCMS: Install](https://craftcms.com/docs/getting-started-tutorial/install/)

```sh
mkdir my-crafty-site
cd my-crafty-site/
ddev config --project-type=php --php-version=8.0 --docroot=web --create-docroot
ddev composer create -y craftcms/craft
# Are you ready to begin the setup? (yes|no) [no]: yes
```

You need to input the following answers:

_TODO: How can the following be automated?_

> Which database driver are you using? <br>(mysql or pgsql) â†’ mysql (default)<br>
> Database server name or IP address â†’ db<br>
> Database port â†’ 3306 (default)<br>
> Database username â†’ db<br>
> Database password â†’ db<br>
> Database name â†’ db<br>
> Database table prefix â†’ (leave blank)

> Answer yes to the prompt on whether to install Craft now, and answer the remaining prompts as you like. The only one that matters is Site URL, which you should answer with https://tutorial.ddev.site.

The above is quoted from [Intro to CraftCMS: Install](https://craftcms.com/docs/getting-started-tutorial/install/).

Afterwards:

```sh
ddev launch
```

**TODO:** If you want to make the repository publicly available via GitHub, you might to move the license key to `.env` https://github.com/craftcms/craft/issues/42
