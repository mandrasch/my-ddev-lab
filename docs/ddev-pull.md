# DDEV pull

`ddev pull` will change your daily dev life, I promise!

The official docs for this DDEV feature can be found here:

- https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/providers/
- [rsync example](https://github.com/drud/ddev/blob/master/pkg/ddevapp/dotddev_assets/providers/rsync.yaml.example)

I used `ddev pull` mostly for WordPress, see the according sub pages to get more information:

- [Pulling WordPress](cms-and-frameworks/wordpress.html#pulling-wordpress)

This can also be used for other CMS like [Typo3](cms-and-frameworks/typo3.html), but I haven't published (or found) demo code.
