# Hello!

This site contains _experimental_ projects done with [DDEV](/what-is-ddev).

My main goal is to enable robust and standardized local development instances. Additionally I try to enable one-click-development in the browser via [Gitpod](/ddev-meets-gitpod) as much as possible.

ðŸš§ &nbsp;Most of this stuff is _Work in Progress_, but I hope it offers some helpful insights.

Cheers and have fun!
