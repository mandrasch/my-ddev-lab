# Hello!

This site contains _experimental_ projects done with [DDEV](https://ddev.com/).

In most cases I tried to support the usage of the cloud IDE [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/). My goal is to enable robust local development as well as one-click-in-browser development (if needed).

Thanks for all people sharing their DDEV snippets and examples! Please consider [sponsoring DDEV maintainer Randy Fay](https://github.com/sponsors/rfay) if you use DDEV in your daily work.

## What is DDEV?

DDEV is an awesome open Source tool to create local development enviroments which can be shared via git.
