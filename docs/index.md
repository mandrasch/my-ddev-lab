# Hello!

This site contains my personal notes on working with [DDEV](/what-is-ddev) in my web projects.

My main goal is to enable robust and standardized local development instances for a great developer experience in team projects.

Additionally I try to enable one-click-development in the browser via [Gitpod](/ddev-meets-gitpod) in the demo projects.

As a developer I follow the https://sustainablewebdesign.org/ approach as much as possible + build accessible websites which are WCAG-compliant.

Kudos to DDEV maintainer Randy Fay, all DDEV contributors and my developer colleagues at [gugler\* MarkenSinn](https://markensinn.at/) who introduced me to DDEV!

Cheers and have fun!<br>
