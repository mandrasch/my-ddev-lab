# Hi there!

These are my personal notes for modern web development with [DDEV](/what-is-ddev).

Most stuff is experimental, many notes are quite messy - but I hope it offers some helpful insights for you. My own work and scripts are available as open source, feel free to re-use.

Cheers and have fun!<br>
