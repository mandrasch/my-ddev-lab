# Hello!

This site contains _experimental_ projects done with [DDEV](https://ddev.com/).

In most cases I tried to additionally support the usage of the cloud IDE [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/). My goal is to enable robust local development as well as (optional) one-click-development in the browser window.

::: info
This site is Work in Progress.

## What is DDEV?

DDEV is an awesome open source tool to create local development enviroments which can be shared via git. It enables standardized development environments.
